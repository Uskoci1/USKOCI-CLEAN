# V28 reference screens (rendered, not reconstructed)

These screens show the owner's V28 prototype as it actually runs. They were rendered in headless Edge
at 412×(900–1500) CSS px and a device scale of 2 on 2026-09-22:
- source: `C:/Users/user/Downloads/USKOCI_V28_PREGLED (1).html`, SHA256
  `29fbe6cbdcf333fc9594ab3c552871b444ea9e16bb9884f13d0ba36c35337314`;
- each screen was opened through the prototype's own `go()`, `openTask()` and `state` calls;
- the data is the prototype's local demo data, not USKOČI records.

| `v28-06-dogovori.png` | Dogovori list |

The measured colours, sizes and card values are in `../V31_IDENTICAL_LOOK_20260922.md`.
The prototype's defects are listed there too: text under 12 px, the five Lottie animations hidden by
their own background circle, "0 prijava" noise, and demo-only concepts.

These are a starting point, not a pixel lock. The owner accepts better solutions where they serve the
user.
