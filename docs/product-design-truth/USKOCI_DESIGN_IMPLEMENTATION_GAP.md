## Cross-cutting implementation findings

- Canonical shell is still the older three-zone navigation; the latest owner decision locks five role-specific tabs and supersedes that shell for final design.
- Presentation screens mostly consume ports/projections. One material exception is the worker profile client service, which performs owner-scoped direct `app_profiles` writes inside the data layer; no screen itself writes Supabase.
- AI Edge authority, durable facts and draft save exist; actual OpenAI provider success with the current secret/model remains unproven.
- Push registry/preferences/event infrastructure exists; provider delivery and real device receipt remain unproven.
- Reviews, voice, media storage, identity verification, full settings/data rights and a hard calendar UI are absent.
- HITNO/dispatch foundations exist but must remain visibly gated until policy/config and end-to-end proof allow activation.
- Completion needs lifecycle hardening before design can treat replay and cancelled/superseded terminal behavior as closed.
