/**
 * EX-04 (S1 A09 Moji zadaci, S2 B10 Moje prijave): the ONE owner of a personal list that is read a keyset page at a time. React-free and clock-injected, so every
 * rule below is a plain test. The list-specific parts (the scopes, the cursor, the counts, the key of an item) are type parameters; the rules are the same for both lists.
 *
 * - One set per scope (the tabs of the screen), kept while the screen lives: coming back to a tab shows what it had and re-reads quietly, exactly as
 *   `createFocusedResource` does for a whole list. The app leaving the foreground forgets everything (the recents photograph).
 * - A read belongs to one epoch (focus), one set and one version of it. A page that started before the first page replaced the set, before a blur, a
 *   background or a change of account is discarded: an old cursor never meets a new set ("Insert/update tokom listanja ne prihvata stari cursor").
 * - A page never duplicates an item; an item seen twice stays where it was first seen (an item that moved to a later section between two pages is shown where the
 *   walk first met it, never twice).
 * - The counts come with the first page of ANY scope and are the only counts there are: a tab badge never counts what happens to be loaded.
 * - Returning to a screen re-reads as many pages as were loaded (bounded), so the reading position survives; a pull-to-refresh starts again from the top.
 * - `ensureComplete(true)` reads the rest of the set, one page at a time up to a bound, for as long as a search, a filter or a destination that must be found
 *   refines it: a refinement of an incomplete set would answer wrongly. With `until` it stops as soon as what is loaded satisfies it (the destination has been met),
 *   checked before every further page, so a page is never read for something that is already on screen.
 * - A first page that fails shows an error only when nothing is on screen; a later page that fails keeps the list and asks for a retry at its foot.
 * - `reload` is the first page asked for by a screen that owns its own read (it answers whether the page is now fresh and on screen); `start` is the focus of a screen that
 *   lets the pager read for it.
