/**
 * Ten places wrote an amount of money by hand.
 *
 * `${n.toLocaleString('sr-Latn-RS')} RSD` appeared in the application, candidate, need and agreement
 * client services, in both the Supabase and the fake source, in the task presentation twice, and in
 * the intake card. Nine of the ten agreed.
 *
 * The tenth, the fake source's candidate list, was `${k.cenaRsd} RSD` — no grouping at all. One
 * screen said "18000 RSD" while every other screen said "18.000 RSD", and because it was in the
 * fake source nobody looking at real data would ever have seen it.
 *
 * Same shape as the Serbian plural: a rule everybody knows is a rule everybody rewrites, and the
 * copy that drifts is the one nobody is looking at.
